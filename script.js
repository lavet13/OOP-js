/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// What is Object-Oriented Programming
// Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects;
// paradigm simply means the style of the code, so how we write and organize code, now we use objects to model
// (describe) aspects of the real world, like a user or a to-do list item or even more abstract
// features like an HTML component or some kind of data structure. Now as we already know, objects can contain
// data, which we call properties, and also code, which we call methods. So we can say that by using objects,
// we pack all data and the corresponding behavior all into one big block.
// In OOP objects are self-contained pieces of code or blocks of code, like small applications on their own.
// And we then use these objects as building blocks of our applications and make objects interact with
// one another. Now these interactions happen through a so-called public interface, which we also call API.
// This interface is basically a bunch of methods that a code outside of the objects can access and that we
// use to communicate with the object.
// Why does OOP actually exist? Well, the paradigm was developed with the goal of organizing code, so to make
// it more flexible and easier to maintain. So before OOP, we might have a bunch of codes gathered across
// multiple functions, or even in the global scope without any structure. And this particular like crazy style
// of code is what we usually call spaghetti code and spaghetti code makes it very hard to maintain
// large code bases and let alone, add new functionalities to it. So the idea of OOP was basically created
// as a solution to this problem. And apparently it worked because today, OOP is probably the most popular
// and most widely used programming paradigm in large scale software engineering. Now, OOP is certainly not the
// only way of writing organized and maintainable code. So in fact, there're many other paradigms that have
// become increasingly popular and one of them is functional programming. And functional programming allows us
//  to achieve the exact same goal of basically avoiding spaghetti code. And as I have been saying, we will talk
//  about functional programming later in the course and compare it with OOP. But for now, let's focus on OOP.
//  We have been using objects all the time. However, up until now, we have basically only used objects as loose
//  collections of data and without making them interact with one another. Also, we didn't have a way to generate
//  objects programmatically. All we ever did was using simple object literals, but in OOP, we actually need
//  a way to generate, so to create, new objects from our code. And to do that in traditional OOP, we use
//  something called CLASSES. You can think of a class as a blueprint, which can then be used to create
//  new objects based on the rules described in the class. So it's just like an architecture where the architect
//  develops a blueprint to exactly plan and describe a house. But the blueprint is really just an abstract plan,
//  like a set of rules, but nothing tangible(заметный) that you can actually touch.
//
// "How do we actually design classes? How do we model real-world data into classes?"
// And that's of course a very good question. Now the answer is, as you can imagine, not straightforward.
// So there is not a single correct way of designing classes. There are, however, 4 fundamental principles
// that can guide us toward a good class implementation. And these principles are abstraction, encapsulation,
// inheritance and polymorphism. And these are actually techniques that can also be used outside of OOP, but
// they are especially relevant in this context.

// First one is abstraction.

// Abstraction basically means to ignore or to hide details that don't matter.
// This allows us to get an overview perspective of whatever it is that we are implementing instead of
// messing(возиться) with details that don't really matter to our implementation.
// Abstraction is really important, not just in OOP, but in programming in general. In fact, we create and use
// abstractions all the time. For example, take the addEventListener function that we used all the time. Do we
// actually know how exactly it works behind the scenes? Well, we don't. And do we care? No, not really. Right?
// And we don't have to because once more, the low-level details of how exactly it works has been obstructed
// away from us. We are simply the user. And so we can simply use that function without completely understanding
// it and without having to implement it ourselves. So that's abstraction, which actually blends in with the next
// principle, which is encapsulation.

// Encapsulation is basically means to keep some properties and methods
// private inside the class so that they're not accessible from outside the class. However, some methods can,
// of course, be exposed as a public interface, which we call API. And this is exactly what I meant
// at the beginning of the lecture when I said that interactions between objects happen through a public
// interface.
// state refers to an object's data
// so we want no one else outside of the class to be able to use this method, and so basically we don't make it
// part of the public interface, so the public interface is essentially all the methods that are not private,
// so that are not encapsulated. So making methods private makes it easier for us to change our code without
// breaking code from the outside, which might rely on some of these methods. For example, if the check spam
// method was public, then it could be used anywhere in our code. And if we then changed the implementation of
// the method, it might break that code that is relying on it. So in summary, we should always have the goal to
// nicely encapsulate most of our state and methods and only leaving essential methods public for the reasons
// that I just explained. Next up, we have inheritance.

// Inheritance
// When we have two separate identities(classes) we will
// end up with a lot of duplicate code and we already know that that's bad. So in OOP, when we have two classes
// that are closely related, like user and admin, we can have one class inherit from the other. So we will
// have one parent class and one child class, and the child class then extends(расширяет) the parent class. But
// what does all of that actually mean? Well, it's actually quite intuitive, I think. So just like you as a child
// probably inherited some features of your parents, a child class inherits all the properties and methods from
// it's parent class. Now, in more formal terms, inheritance makes all properties and methods of a certain class
// available to a child class, which of course then forms a hierarchy between these two classes. And the goal
// of this is to reuse logic that is common to both of the classes. In this case, both the admin and the user
// need to log in. And so instead of writing that logic twice, it makes sense to inherit the login method from
// the more global class, which is the parent class user, to the more specific class, which is the child class
// admin. Now of course a child class can then also have it's own methods and properties. So at the end of the
// day the child class ends up with some methods and properties from it's parent and some of it's own. So we
// can say that the admin is also a user, but basically an extended user, so with some added functionality.

// Finally, last principle is polymorphism. Means that a child class can overwrite a method that it inherited
// from a parent class. And here are our user and admin classes again. But now we also have a third class, which
// which is the author. Now admin and author are both really just special kinds of users, and so it makes sense
// that they both inherit from the user class. Therefore, they inherit all the properties and methods from the
// user class. Let's say that an admin requires a different kind of login method. For example, a more secure one
// which has two-factor authentication. And let's say that we also need a special login method for authors.
// Well, in each class we simply just write a new method, which is also called login. And then, according to
// polymorphism, that login method will overwrite the login method that has been inherited from the user class.
// And that's actually it

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// OOP in JavaScript
// process of creating an instance is called instantiation.
// In JavaScript we have something called prototypes, and all objects in JavaScript are linked to a certain
// prototype object. So we say that each object has a prototype. And now here comes the magic. So,
// the prototype object contains methods and properties that all objects that are linked to that prototype.
// And this behavior is usually called prototypal inheritance. So, again, prototypal inheritance means that
// all objects that are linked to a certain prototype object can use the methods and properties that are
// defined on that prototype. So basically, objects inherit methods and properties from the prototype which
// is the reason why this mechanism is called PROTOTYPAL INHERITANCE. Just note that this inheritance is
// actually different from the inheritance that we talked about in the last lecture. So that was one class
// inheriting from another class. But in this case, it's basically an instance inheriting from a class.
// So that's very different and so keep that in mind. Now we can also say that objects delegate behavior
// to the linked prototype object. And behavior is just another term for methods here. So besides
// prototypal inheritance, we also call this mechanism DELEGATION. And that's also the reason why this
// arrow is pointing UPWARDS because technically, objects delegate their behavior to the prototype.
// On the other hand, in classical OOP with classes, the behavior, so the methods, are actually copied
// from the class to the objects and so that is completely different. So Jonas knows that this is a lot of new
// stuff to take in, so a lot of new words and new concepts. But this is just to paint a very clear picture
// and to give you the complete overview. What is matters to him is that i understand how does prototypal
// inheritance actually works. Because, when we actually start using this in practice in the next lecture,
// it won't really matter if it's called inheritance or delegation as long as it just works as intended
// But since you came to this course to learn how things actually work in JavaScript, I'm giving you all
// that information here. Even though for now it looks a little bit too much, but i'm sure you will find
// it useful eventually. So actually, we will come back to this diagram and fill it with some more detail
// after we have actually implemented prototypes in JavaScript. So after you have actually see how they work
// in practice. And by then, i'm sure that all this will make 100% sense to you. But anyway, we have actually
// already seen this mechanism in action many times before but without knowing that it was happening.
// For example, each time that we used an array method like map, we are able to use that method because of
// prototypal inheritance. So, when you go to MDN to check the documentation for any array method, what you will see
// there is that it's actually called Array.prototype.map(), but why is that relevant? So, what does this mean?
// Well, array.prototype is the prototype object of all the arrays that we create in JavaScript. Now this prototype
// object contains all the array methods, including map. So, this is where they are actually defined. So, since
// array.prototype is the prototype of the num array, it means that num is linked to that prototype. And therefore
// it has access to all the methods that are defined on the array.prototype object, just like the map method. So,
// in a sense, our array inherits the map method. Or again, we can also say that the array delegated the behavior
// of mapping to it's prototype. So, you can choose whatever makes more sense in your mind. But what matters is
// that the map method is actually not defined on the num array itself but on it's prototype. And of course, we're
// gonna check out this behavior also in our code in practice. Now you might have a ton of questions in your head.
// Like, how do we actually create prototypes? And, how do we link objects to prototypes? And how can we create new
// objects without having classes from which we can instantiate objects? So, in summary, the question is  how do we
// implement Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript in practice? Well, in JavaScript there are actually three different
// ways of doing all this:
// 1. the constructor function technique;
// 2. ES6 classes;
// 3. Object.create(); // not that used
//
// So first, constructor functions are a way of creating objects programmatically using a function which will also set
// the new object's prototype. And this is actually how built-in objects like arrays or maps or sets are implemented.
// Also, this is how OOP has been done in JavaScript basically since the beginning.
//
// Next, the ES6 release introduced classes into JavaScript. And so now, ES6 classes are actually the more modern way
// of doing OOP in JavaScript. However keep in mind that these are actually not the kind of classses that we
// talked about. They are instead just so-called 'synthetic sugar' over constructor functions. So this means that ES6
// classes are basically just a layer of obstruction over constructor functions. So it's really just a nicer syntax that
// makes it easier for newcomers to do OOP in JavaScript. But behind the scenes, ES6 classes are actually implemented
// with constructor functions. And so they also use prototypal inheritance.
//
// Finally, there's also the Object.create() function which is basically the easiest and most straightforward way of
// linking an object to a prototype object. However, it's not as used as the other two methods as we will see over the
// next couple of lectures.
//
// Now to finish, one important thing to keep in mind is that the four principles of OOP, so that's abstraction,
// encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are still valid and important with prototypal inheritance.
// let's now finally put OOP into practice and get a bit more technical.

/*
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Constructor Functions and the new Operator
// So, we can use constructor functions, to build an object using a function. Now, a constructor function is actually
// a completely(вполне) normal function. The only difference between a regular function and a function that we call constructor
// function is that we call a constructor function with the new OPERATOR.

// in OOP there is this convention that constructor functions always start with a capital letter
// And in fact, other a build-in constructors like array or map or set, follow that convention as well
// Now here i'm using a function expression but of course a function declaration will also work.
// Now an arrow function will actually not work as a function constructor and that's because it doesn't have it's own
// this keyword and we need that. So only function declarations and function expressions.

// this function is basically gonna produce an object and in this case from a Person.
const Person = function (firstName, birthYear) {
    // let's use this knowledge to our advantage, because we already know that in the end of this function
    // the this keyword will basically be returned

    // Instance properties, because properties firstName and birthYear will be available on all the instances
    // that are created through this constructor function
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.birthYear = birthYear;

    // Never do this, because imagine we were gonna create a hundred or thousands or even ten of thousands of person
    // objects using this constructor function. Then what would happen is that each of these objects would carry around
    // this function here. So if we had a thousand objects, we would essentially create a thousand copies of this function.
    // and so that would be terrible for the performance of our code. Again, don't do this.
    //this.calcAge = function () {
    //console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
    //};

    // But instead to solve this problem, we are gonna use prototypes and prototypal inheritance.
    // Function constructors are not really a feature of the JavaScript language. Instead, they are simply a pattern that
    // has been developed by other developers. And now everyone simply uses this. And this now includes you as a new
    // developer. So the real magic really here is this new operator. And the most important thing to understand is
    // really these four steps.

    // So behind the scenes, there have been four steps.
    // 1. New empty object is created, then afterwards
    // 2. function is called, and (this = {}, so basically in the execution context of the Person function, the this keyword
    // will point to this new object that was created in step number one) in this function call the this keyword will be set
    // to this newly created object.
    // 3. newly created object is linked to the prototype.
    // 4. function automatically return {}; The object that was created in the beginning is then automatically returned from
    // the constructor function

    // by the end of the function our the "this" keyword now has these two new properties;
};

// we call the constructor function using the new keyword
// this new operator is actually a very special operator because what it does is to call this function here. So this Person
// function, but it does a whole lot more than just that
const jonas = new Person('Jonas', 1991);

// we can use this constructor function to create as many different objects as we want
const matilda = new Person('Matilda', 2017);
const jack = new Person('Jack', 1975);

const jay = 'Jay';

console.log(jonas instanceof Person);
console.log(jay instanceof Person);

// STATIC METHOD
// there's no way that jonas object could inherit it. Only using function constructor we have access directly to method "hey" which is carried around by constructor property of Person
Person.hey = function () {
    console.log(`Hey there! ${this.firstName}`);
    console.log(this); // whatever object is calling the method will be the "this" keyword inside of that function, and so here the "this" keyword is simply that entire constructor function.
};

Person.hey();
console.log(jonas);
console.log(matilda, jack);

// we can create as many objects now based on this constructor function, and so this is a bit like the analogy from before,
// where this constructor function, is now the blueprint for a house, and then each of these objects that we create through
// that function. So through that blueprint will be the actual house in the real world. So in this case, the actual objects
// with actual data in them. So Matilda and Jack, and so of course, now each of them is it's own new object that we created
// programmatically, using a function constructor. In classical OOP an object created from a class is called an instance,
// Now we didn't technically create a class here because as we discussed before JavaScript doesn't really have classes in
// the sense of traditional OOP. However we did create three objects from a constructor function. And constructor functions
// have been used since the beginning of JavaScript to kind of simulate classes, and so therefore we can still say that,
// for example, jonas is an instance of Person and the same goes for Matilda and for Jack.

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Prototypes
// Well, it can be summarized like this: So, first each and every function in JavaScript automatically has a property
// called prototype and that includes, of course, constructor functions. Now every object that's created by a certain
// constructor function will get access to all the methods and properties that we define on the constructor prototype
// property. So just to visualize in our case, this would be:
console.log(Person.prototype); // All the objects that are created through this constructor function will inherit, so they
// will get access to all the methods and properties that are defined on the prototype property of Person

// that effectively solves this problem that we had before when we added the calcAge method directly to each of the
// objects. We would have created a copy of this method and attached it to every single object and so that's why
// we don't do this. Instead, what we do is this. Because now there exists only one copy of this function. So only one of
// them exists, but then all of the objects that are created using the constructor function can basically reuse this
// function on themselves. And so the "this" keyword, of course, in each of them is as always set to the object that is
// calling the method

Person.prototype.calcAge = function () {
    console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
};

jonas.calcAge();
matilda.calcAge();
// But how and why does this actually work? Well, it works because any object always has access to the methods and properties
// from it's prototype. And the prototype of Jonas and Matilda is Person.prototype;
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas)); // So the prototype of the Jonas object is essentially the prototype property of
// the constructor function
console.log(Person.prototype);
console.log(jonas);
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas) === Person.prototype); // true, sounded incredibly confusing, didn't it?
// So shouldn't Person.prototype be the prototype of Person. Well, actually, no. So this is the confusing part.
// So Person.prototype is actually not the prototype of Person. But instead it is what's gonna be used as the prototype of
// all the objects that are created with the Person constructor function, so that's a subtle but important difference that
// you need to keep in mind and in fact, what i just said that is confirmed by this comparison
// (Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas) === Person.prototype)

console.log(jonas instanceof Person);
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(jonas)); // this should also become true and indeed it is, so this confirms
// one more time that Person.prototype is indeed the prototype of Jonas
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(matilda)); // the same for Matilda of course as well
console.log(Person.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Person)); // Person.prototype is not the prototype of Person, it is false, so
// this very common confusion comes from bad naming of this property. So the fact that it's called prototype
// kind of implies that this is the prototype of Person, but as we just learned, it is actually not. Probably shouldn't
// be called prototype but instead something like prototypeOfLinkedObjects

// Anyway, where does proto property on the Jonas object actually come from? Well, remember the new operator that we talked about
// before, well, it contains step number three, which links the empty new object to the prototype.

Person.prototype.species = 'Homo Sapiens';
console.log(jonas.species, matilda.species);

// So own properties are only the ones that are declared directly on the object itself.
// So not including the inherited properties.
console.log(jonas.hasOwnProperty('species')); // false, that's because this property is not really inside of the Jonas object. It simply
// has access to it because of it's prototype, so because it's in the prototype property of Person. It doesn't look for methods or properties in prototype chain

//////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Prototypal Inheritance and The Prototype Chain
// Let's now consolidate the knowledge that we got in a nice diagram that brings everything together that we know so far
// const jonas = new Person('jonas', 1990);
// And everything starts with the Person the constructor function that we've been developing. Now this constructor function has a prototype
// property which is an object and inside that object, we defined the calcAge method and Person.prototype itself actually also has a
// reference back to Person which is the constructor property. So, essentially Person.prototype.constructor is gonna point back to Person
// itself. Now remember, Person.prototype is actually not the prototype of Person but of all the objects that are created through the
// Person function and speaking of the created objects let's now actually analyze how an object is created using the new operator and
// the constructor function. So when we call a function, any function with the new operator:
// 1. the first thing that is gonna happen is that a new empty object is created instantly.
// 2. Then the this keyword in the function call is set to the newly created object. So, inside the function's execution context
// this is now the new empty object and that's why in the function's code we set the name and birth year properties on the "this" keyword
// because doing so will ultimately set them on the new object. So next comes the magical step.
// 3. So now the new object is linked to the constructor function's prototype property so in this case, Person.prototype and this happens
// internally by adding __proto__ to the new object. So Person.prototype is now the new object's prototype which is denoted in the
// __proto__ property of Jonas. So again, underscore proto always points to an object prototype and that's true for all objects in JavaScript
// 4. Finally, the new object is automatically returned from the function unless we explicitly return something else. But in a constructor
// function like Person we usually never do that. Okay, and with this the result of the new operator and the Person constructor function is a
// new object that we just created programmatically and that is now stored in the Jonas variable and this whole process that I just explained
// is how it works with function constructors and also with ES6 classes but not with the Object.create syntax that we're gonna use later.
// But anyway, why does this work this way and why is this technique so powerful and useful? and to answer that let's move on jonas.calcAge();
// So, here we are attempting to call the calcAge function on the jonas object. However, JavaScript can actually not find the calcAge function
// directly in the Jonas object. It is simply not there and we already observed this behavior. So, what happens now in this situation? Well,
// if a property or a method cannot be found in a certain object JavaScript will look into it's prototype and there it is. So there is the
// calcAge function that we were looking for and so JavaScript will simply use this one. That's how the calcAge function can run correctly
// and return a result. And the behavior that we just described is what we already called prototypal inheritance or delegation. So the jonas
// object inherited the calcAge method from it's prototype or in other words it delegated the calcAge functionality to it's prototype. Now,
// the beauty of this is that we can create as many Person objects as we like and all of them will then inherit this method. So we can call
// this calcAge method on all the Person objects without the method being directly attached to all the objects themselves and this is essential
// for code performance. Just imagine that we had a 1,000 objects in the code and if all of them would have to carry the calcAge function
// around then that would certainly impact the performance. So instead, they can all simply use the calcAge function from their common prototype
// So that makes sense. Now the fact that Jonas is connected to a prototype and the ability of looking up methods and properties in a prototype
// is what we call the prototype chain. So the jonas object and it's prototype basically form a prototype chain but actually the prototype chain
// does not end here. So let's understand the prototype chain a bit better by zooming out and looking at the whole picture. So, here is the
// diagram that we already had with the Person function constructor and it's prototype property and to Jonas object linked to it's prototype via
// the underscore proto property, so nothing new yet. But now let's remember that Person.prototype itself is also an object and all objects in
// JavaScript have a prototype. Therefore, Person.prototype itself must also have a prototype. And the prototype of Person.prototype is
// Object.prototype. Why is that? Well, Person.prototype is just a simple object which means that it has been built by the built-in object
// constructor function and this is actually the function that is called behind the scenes whenever we create an object literal. So just an object
// simply with curly braces. So essentially the curly braces are just like a shortcut to writing a new object. But anyway, what matters here is that
// Person.prototype itself needs to have a prototype and since it has been created by the Object constructor function it's prototype is gonna be
// Object.prototype, it's the same logic as with the Jonas object. So, since Jonas has been built by a Person, Person.prototype is the prototype of
// Jonas. Now this entire series of links between the objects is what is called the prototype chain and Object.prototype is usually the top of the
// prototype chain which means that it's prototype is null. So it's underscore proto property will simply point to null which then marks the end of
// the prototype chain. So in a certain way the prototype chain is very similar to the scope chain but with prototypes. So, in the scope chain
// whenever JavaScript can't find a certain variable in a certain scope, it looks up into the next scope and tries to find the
// variable there. On the other hand in the prototype chain whenever JavaScript can't find a certain property or method in a certain object it's
// gonna look up into the next prototype in the prototype chain and see if it can find it there. So again the prototype chain is pretty similar
// to the scope chain but instead of working with scopes, it works with properties and methods in objects.
//
/////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Prototypal Inheritance on Built-In Objects

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas)); // Person.prototype
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(jonas))); // Object.prototype(top of prototype chain)

// However, what we just did, so extending the prototype of a built-in object is generally not a good idea.
// don't really get the habit of doing this for multiple reasons:
// first reason is that the next version of JavaScript might add a method with the same name that we are adding; but it might work in a different way.
// And so your code will then use that new method which, remember, works differently, and then that will probably break your code.
// second reason why you shouldn't do this is because when you work on a team of developers, then this is really gonna be a bad idea, because if multiple
// developers implement the same method with a different name then that's going to create so many bugs that it's just not worth doing this. So it's just
// a nice and fun experiment but in practice, you should probably not do it.

// 1. Classes are NOT hoisted, so even if they are class declarations. (functions declarations are hoisted which means we can use them before they are declared in the code, but with classes, that doesn't work)
// 2. Just like functions, classes are also first-class citizens. (means that we can pass them into functions and also return them from functions, because classes are really just a special kind of function behind the scenes)
// 3. The body of the class is always executed in strict mode, and so even if we didn't activate it for our entire script, all the code that is in the class will be executed in strict mode.
// you might ask if you should use constructor functions, like we have been doing or if, instead, it's better to just use classes, and the first remark I want to do is that constructor functions are not like old or deprecated syntax.
// So it's 100% fine to keep using them. So one more time, this is more a question of personal preference. Now, if you're asking if you should use classes without understanding prototypal inheritance, well, then
// the reply is definitely no. Now, some people actually say that classes are really bad in general and that no one should ever be using them simply because they hide the true nature of JavaScript. But I actually don't agree
// with that, and I think it's absolutely okay to use classes in your code as long as you understand everything. You want to feel comfortable while writing your code, and that essentially means to understand exactly what your code
// does. So that's super important too and so if you want to be confident, you need to understand. And so that's also the whole reason why all over the course, Jonas is going into such deep detail into how everything works in
// JavaScript. Now, what I personally like about classes is that they visually put all the code that belongs to a certain class so like all the data and all the behavior, all into one nice code block. With function constructors
// in my opinion, it all looks just like a big mess. So it can get out of hand pretty quick. What matters is that you start thinking about this yourself and take your own decisions based on what Jonas is explaining.

// Static Methods
// Array.from, method from is really a method that is attached to the Array constructor, so we couldn't use the from method on an array instance.
// so this is not gonna work
// [1, 2, 3].from() - an error
// so from method is really attached to the entire constructor, so the Array constructor and not to the prototype property of the constructor.
// And therefore all the arrays don't inherit this method, again because it's not on their prototype. it simply attached to the constructor itself.
// So Array.from is basically just a simple function, but it's a function that's attached to the Array constructor and the reason for that is simply
// so that developers know that it's related to arrays. We also say that the from method is in the Array namespace and we actually used that term before
// for some methods in the number and in the internationalization namespace. For example, Number.parseFloat so this method is another static method and it's
// static on the Number constructor, so it's not available on numbers, but only on this very constructor. So maybe you can imagine that it should be pretty easy
// to implement static methods ourselfs.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Object.create
// third way of implementing prototypal inheritance or delegation and that is to use a function called Object.create() which works in a pretty different way
// than constructor functions and classes work. There is still the idea of prototypal inheritance. However, there are no prototype properties involved and also
// no constructor functions and no new operator, so instead, we can use Object.create to essentially manually set the prototype of an object to any other object that we want.

const PersonProto = {
    calcAge() {
        console.log(2037 - this.birthYear);
    },

    init(firstName, birthYear) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.birthYear = birthYear;
    },
};

// returns a brand new object that is linked to the prototype that we passed in.
const steven = Object.create(PersonProto);

steven.name = 'Steven';
steven.birthYear = 2002;
steven.calcAge();
console.log(steven);

// When we use the new operator in constructor functions or classes, it automatically sets the prototype of the instances to the constructor's prototype property.
// Now on the other hand, with Object.create, we can set the prototype of objects manually to any object that we want. And in this case, we manually set the prototype of the Steven object
// to the PersonProto object. Now two objects are effectively linked through the proto property, just like before. So now looking at properties or methods in a prototype chain works just like it worked
// in function constructors or classes. And so the prototype chain, in fact, looks exactly the same. The big difference is that we didn't need any constructor function and also no prototype property at all
// to achieve the exact same thing. So this is actually a bit more straightforward and a bit more natural. And I guess, that it might also be easier to understand. In real world applications, this is actually
// the least used way of implementing prototypal inheritance. However, it's still very important to know exactly how Object.create works, because you will still stumble upon this in the real world. And even more
// importantly, we will need Object.create to link prototypes in the next lecture, in order to implement inheritance between classes. So with that, we are gonna take OOP to a whole new level. And the Object.create function is
// gonna be crucial in that, as we will see. And of course, we can now verify everything I just said, using code here.

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(steven) === PersonProto); // that is now exactly the object that we specified above.

// Encapsulation_ Protected Properties and Methods
// encapsulation basically means to keep some properties and methods private inside the class so that they are not accessible from outside of the class.
// Then the rest of the methods are basically exposed as a public interface, which we can also call API. So this is essential to do in anything more than a toy application.
// Two big reasons why we need encapsulation and data privacy:
// 1. Prevent code from outside of a class to accidentally manipulate our data inside the class. And that's exactly what we did by the end of the last lecture here.
// 2. When we expose only a small interface so a small API consisting only of a few public methods then we can change all the other internal methods with more confidence.
// Because in this case, we can be sure that external code does not rely on these private methods and so therefore our code will not break when we do internal changes. So
// that's what encapsulation and data privacy are and the reasons for it.
// JavaScript actually don't yet support real data privacy and encapsulation. Now there is a proposal to add truly private class fields and methods to the language but it's not
// completely ready yet. I will still show it to you in the next lecture but even when this feature ships in the browser it will take some time until you can use it with confidence.
// We will basically fake encapsulation by simply using a convention.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Encapsulation_ Private Class Fields and Methods
// why is the proprosal called Class fields? in traditional OOP languages like Java and C++, properties are usually called fields. So what this means is that with this new proposal,
// JavaScript is moving away from the idea that classes are just syntactic sugar over constructor functions. Because with this new class features classes actually start to have abilities
// that we didn't previously have with constructor functions. Now to many developers consider this to be a big problem, but personally, i'm not sure if it is a such a big deal for average JavaScript developer.
// So as long as you still understand how prototypal inheritance and function constructors work then I believe that you will be fine. But anyway, no matter if you end up using these new class features, let's now start
// exploring them.
// In this proposal there are actually four different kinds of fields and methods, and actually it's even eight but it's fine
// 1. Public fields
// 2. Private fields
// 3. Public methods
// 4. Private methods - seems not to work
//
// 5. Public static fields
// 6. Private static fields
// 7. Public static methods
// 8. Private static methods - i guess work, but if so, when do i actually use that or never needed probably which more likely
